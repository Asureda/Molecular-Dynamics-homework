MB_velocityDistribution : distribution of velocities calculated from Fortran
velocity_old : velocities at the inital of the simulation
velocity_new : velocities at the final of the simulation
TP_red_equil : T,P from the equilibration process (just for seeing that the Andersern thermo works!)
thermodynamics : KE,V,E,T,P from the production run
stats : mean and standard deviation from the production run
