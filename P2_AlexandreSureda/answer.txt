!	Investigate what happens if you modify the value of the timestep.
!	Is the total energy conserved? And the total momentum?

!	For the Velocity Verlet algorithm, for dt = 0.0001 to dt = 0.01 there are no significative
!	diferences, total energy is conserved, an we get oscillating
!	complementary solutions for the kinetic and the potential energy
!	However, for dt = 0.1, we get little oscillations of the energy. The momentum is always conserverd.

	For the Euler algorithm, for dt = 0.0001 the energy is conserved, from dt = 0.001 the solution begins to be unstable,
	can be seen that de velocities and the distances between the particles increases at each time step, but the total 
	momentum is conserved.

	This is because the verlet algorithm is a sympletic integrator, which preserves the area of ​​the phase space at 
	all times, making the Jacobian of the transformation of the area map equal to 1. The advantage of symplectic 
	algorithms is that they possess global stability. 
	Since the area bounded by adjacent trajectories is preserved, we can never have the situation that we saw
	for the Euler algorithm earlier in the class, where the coordinates (and hence the energy)
	increase without bound, because this would expand the area. Even in better non-symplectic
	approximations, such as RK2 and RK4, the energy will deviate substantially from its initial
	value at sufficiently long times.
